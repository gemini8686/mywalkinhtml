        <p>I've grown to develop interest in <em>tech</em> and of recent this has grown, because I've grown to understand that there are lots of opportunities in it. My quest for the <em>Tech field</em> has continued to grow overtime. Sometime last year I had to get a new PC which I believed would serve me better than the one I was using then. After getting it I was cash trapped that the cash I had at hand wasn't tangible enough to get me registered into an <em>I.T.</em> school. I had to source means to increase my funds. A friend told me something about <em>FX</em>. I induldged into <em>FOREX</em> but instead of making money I lost the cash I had at hand, that I wanted to augment.<br>
          My journey into programming has been somewhat interesting with missed feelings. I can vividly remember that as I was looking for means to source my cash for the tuition for the I.T. school I was also searching for online classes that I can learn confortably due to the cash constraints I was limited so limited in my search, in my search and quest for an online space to learn I didn't realise that what I was searching for was right before me which is <em>Khan Academy</em>.<br>
        <em>    Khan Academy</em> was among the first two online space that I reached out to but I never took it serious, because I had my gazed fixed on courses that were offered in Coursera. But thanks to God that brought me back to <em>Khan academy</em> now I've been able to take this course here and I am improving as the day go by. I believe as the day go by you will get to see my progress here both on <em class="course">Javascript</em>, <em class="course">Website building</em> and <em class="course">CSS</em>.

        My journey with <em>JS</em> is quite an interesting one. I started from making simple shapes to joining them up to form emoji; using the ellipses and lines to draw <em>Winston and emojis</em> with time I was able to create motion pictures with the draw function and its now a bit compound now it has to do with <em>loops and Arrays and making the interface more interactive</em>.

        From day one website developing was my first interest when I came into this space to learn all the time I was dealing with the <em>JS</em>. I was waiting and thinking of when I will get to this point.<br>
        I always thought this would be a hell of an incomprehensive language. But to my greatest surprise here am I dealing with it as it is coming to me. I'm at a point where I can confortably write a simple webpage with little design of color and font.<br>
        I believe with time I will improve and I will be a pro in this. Since I have set my heart to do this.
